  /// \brief A cube is only a set of bits in memory.
  ///
  /// This set can be seen as two bitsets
  ///   - true_var  : a bitset representing variables that
  ///                 are set to true
  ///   - false_var : a bitset representing variables that
  ///                 are set to false
  ///
  /// In the  two vectors a bit set to 1 represent a variable set to
  /// true (resp. false) for the true_var (resp. false_var)
  ///
  /// Warning : a variable cannot be set in both bitset at the
  ///           same time (consistency! cannot be true and false)
  ///
  /// The cube for (a & !b) will be repensented by :
  ///     - true_var  = 1 0
  ///     - false_var = 0 1
  ///
  /// To represent free variables such as in (a & !b) | (a & b)
  /// (wich is equivalent to (a) with b free)
  ///     - true_var  : 1 0
  ///     - false_var : 0 0
  /// This exemple shows that the representation of free variables
  /// is done by unsetting variable in both vector
  ///
  /// To be memory efficient, these two bitsets are contigous in memory
  /// i.e. if we want to represent 35 variables, a cube will be
  /// represented by 4 unsigned int contiguous in memory. The 35
  /// first bits represent truth values. The 29 bits following are
  /// useless. Then, the 35 bits represents false value and the
  /// rest is useless.
  ///
  /// Note that useless bits are only to perform some action efficiently,
  /// i.e. only by ignoring them. The manipulation of cubes must be done
  /// using the cubeset class
