Bricks is a collection of useful C++ code, organised in standalone
header files. By default, the code uses the latest stable C++ standard.
Bricks is publicly available at:
       https://github.com/paradise-fi/divine/tree/master/bricks

This directory only contains the necessary subset to have a
multithreaded hashmap in Spot. The integration with Spot requires
modifications of the original files:
    - prefer <spot/misc/clz.hh> to builtin clz
    - use SPOT_FALLTHROUGH when required

In addition to the previous modifications, and to please both GCC and
Spot compilation options, the following changes have been made:
    - add missing override
    - add missing = default
    - add missing default values


This directory contains the current version of Bricks as of Divine 3.3.2.
