		  requires a cycle proviso to ensure that an action cannot be

		  at least one fully expanded state. We present new
		  heuristics to select which state to expand, hoping to
		  reduce the size of the resulting graph. The choice of the
		  state to expand is done when encountering a
		  \emph{dangerous} edge. Almost all existing provisos expand
		  the source of this edge, while this paper also explores the
		  expansion of the destination and the use of SCC-based
		  information.},
