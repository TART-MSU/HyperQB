  /// \brief Reduce the parity acceptance condition to use a minimal
  /// number of colors.
  ///
  /// This implements an algorithm derived from the following article,
  /// but generalized to all types of parity acceptance.
  /// \cite carton.99.ita
  ///
  /// The kind of parity (min/max) is preserved, but the style
  /// (odd/even) may be altered to reduce the number of colors used.
  ///
  /// If \a colored is true, colored automata are output (this is what
  /// the above paper assumes).  Otherwise, the smallest or highest
  /// colors (depending on the parity kind) is removed to simplify the
  /// acceptance condition.
  ///
  /// If the input uses state-based acceptance, the output will use
  /// state-based acceptance as well.
  ///
  /// A parity automaton, sometimes called a chain automaton, can be
  /// seen as a stack of layers that are alternatively rejecting and
  /// accepting.  For instance imagine a parity max automaton that is
  /// strongly connected.  Removing the transitions with the maximal
  /// color might leave a few transitions that were not labeled by
  /// this maximal color, but that are part of any cycle anymore:
  /// those transition could have been colored with the maximal color,
  /// since any cycle going through them would have seen the maximal
  /// color.  (Once your remove this maximal layer,
  /// your can define the next layer similarly.)
  ///
  /// When \a layered is true all transition that belong to the same
  /// layer receive the same color.  When layer is `false`, only the
  /// transition that where used initially to define the layers (i.e,
  /// the transition with the maximal color in the previous exemple),
  /// get their color adjusted.  The other will receive either no
  /// color (if \a colored is false), or a useless color (if \a colored
  /// is true).  Here "useless color" means the smallest color
  /// for parity max, and the largest color for parity min.
  ///
  /// When \a layered is true, the output of this function is
  /// comparable to what acd_transform() would produce.  The
  /// difference is that this function preserve the kind (min/max) of
  /// parity input, while acd_transform() always output a parity min
  /// automaton.  Additionally, this function needs fewer resources
  /// than acd_transform() because it is already known that the input
  /// is a parity automaton.  In some (historically inaccurate) way,
  /// reduce_parity() can be seen as a specialized version of
  /// acd_transform().
  ///
  /// The reason layered is false by default, is that not introducing
  /// colors in place where there where none occasionally help with
  /// simulation-based reductions.
