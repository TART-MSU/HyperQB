  /// \brief Transform an automaton to use state-based acceptance
  ///
  /// This transformation is independent on the acceptance condition
  /// used.  The implementation supports alternating automata.
  ///
  /// It works by creating an automaton whose states correspond to
  /// pairs (s,colors) for each edge entering state s with colors.  In
  /// other words, we are pushing colors from the edges to their
  /// outgoing states.  The implementation is also able to pull colors
  /// on incoming states in cases where that helps.
  ///
  /// When called on automata that are already known to have
  /// state-based acceptance, this function returns the input
  /// unmodified, not a copy.
  ///
  /// Trues states (any state with an accepting self-loop labeled by
  /// true) are merged in the process.
  ///
  /// The output will have a named property called "original-states"
  /// that is a vector indexed by the produced states, and giving the
  /// corresponding state in the input automaton.  If the input
  /// automaton also had an "original-states" property, the two
  /// vectors will be composed, so the `original-states[s]` in the
  /// output will contains the value of `original-states[y] if state s
  /// was created from state y.
  ///
  /// If the input has a property named "original-classes", then the
  /// above "original-state" property is replaced by an
  /// "original-classes" property such that
  /// original-classes[s] is the class of the original state of s.
