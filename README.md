# Welcome to HyperQB!

HyperQB is a home-grown tool of Bounded Model Checking for Hyperproperties.

Hyperproperty specifies and reasons about important requirements among multiple traces.
We implement our QBF-based algorithm for Bounded Model Checking for Hyperproperty as a tool, HyperQB.

HyperQB includes several parts:
- NuSMV model parsing and Boolean encoding of transition relation and specification,
- HyperLTL formula translation,
- QBF encoding of unfolding with bound k using specific semantics,
- QBF solving with QBF solver QuAbs.  

Our code is under MIT license as presented in LICENSE.tex,
while the existing tool, QuAbs, is under AGPL license.  



## Get Started
You can start using HyperQB in 2 simple steps:
1. First install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 
HyperQB will automatically pull the image and execute the scripts to avoid possible hassle of compiling dependencies!

2. Next, clone the repository and step into the repo:
- ```git clone https://github.com/TART-MSU/HyperQB.git```
- ```cd HyperQB```

You are now ready to run HyperQB!:D



## How to Use
To run HyperQB, execute ```hyperqb.sh``` with the following inputs:
- `<list of models>` written in NuSMV format (as .smv files),
- `<formula>` written in the grammar described in Sec. 4 (as a .hq file),
- `<k>` a natural number 0, specifying the unrolling bound,
- `<sem>` the semantics, which can be -pes, -opt, -hpes or -hopt, and
- `<mode>` to say performing classic BMC (i.e., negating the formula) or not, which can be -bughunt or -find (we use the former as default value).  
    
RUN HyperQB in the following format:
    ```./hyperqube <list of models> <formula> <k> <sem> <mode>```

To observe the tool outputs (i.e., counterexample or witness) 
    See ```*_OUTPUT_formatted.cex``` for parsed outputs have variables, time stamps, and values neatly presented.
    
Demo Examples:
1. [demo 1: run bakery algorithm with symmetry property]
```./hyperqb.sh demo/bakery.smv demo/bakery.smv demo/symmetry.hq 10 -pes```

2. [dem0 2: run SNARK algorithm with linearizability propoerty]
```./hyperqb.sh demo/SNARK_conc.smv demo/SNARK_seq.smv demo/lin.hq 18 -pes```

## One-click Scripts
We provide several convenient scripts for executing exeperiments. 

- run ```./run_demos.sh``` to run demo examples
- run ```./run_tacas21.sh``` to run all experiments for TACAS21
- run ```./run_cav23.sh``` to run all experiments for CAV23 

We also provide all the command lines needed for each experiment in the document *RUN.txt*
